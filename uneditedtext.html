<p>The rapidly globalizing world of business and information systems doesn't scare Nadine Yassine &mdash; in fact, she welcomes it. As a first-generation American born to parents of Lebanese descent, Nadine understands the importance of a global viewpoint, and knew she wanted to incorporate that perspective into her education.</p>

<p>"My father always emphasized travel as I was growing up. I've been to Lebanon, of course, as well as England, France, and Italy, and it has helped me to take everyone's point of view into consideration instead of just having one perspective on the world," Nadine said. Coming to ASU was a "natural fit" for the California-born-but-Phoenix-bred senior.</p>

<p>She was lured by the aspect of remaining close to family and friends as well as the high ranking of the W.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Carey School of Business. She flirted with a few different majors before choosing IS for its mixture of technology, business, marketing, and networking aspects. "I feel like IS provides the best mixture for learning a little about everything in business. And technology is the way the world is going so you can't lose with this major," Nadine said.</p>

<h2>Going global</h2> 

<p>Taking the international course that is required of all IS majors sparked her interest in the global aspect of technology, and she eventually earned her International Business Certificate. Nadine also decided to minor in economics, and selected a variety of globally focused courses that could help her decipher the factors behind the recent collapse of the international financial markets.</p>

<p>"I didn't fully understand everything that was going on in the economy, and that annoyed me. I like to know what's going on," she joked. Nadine also credits ASU's focus on international education with helping her to explore her global side. "We have a lot of opportunities here to interact with people from different countries, and professors pull that global aspect into the classroom as well," she said.</p>

<p>She also crossed paths with many international students who helped shape her viewpoint during her three years as a student worker in the W.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Carey School's Evening MBA program, and in her role as a mentor for new students entering ASU as part of the Barack Obama Scholars program. Indeed, her grasp of the importance globalization now plays in business, economics, and technology helped her stand out among her fellow IS students.</p>

<p>In her recommendation letter Professor <a href="http://wpcarey.asu.edu/Directory/stafffaculty.cfm?cobid=1039191">Michael Goul</a> wrote: "Nadine validates that information systems collapse geographical boundaries ? She has purposefully fashioned her coursework to prepare for global economy realities, and she recognizes the importance of information technologies for enabling globalization, world economic development, and international business."</p> 

<h2>A standout among peers</h2> 

<p>Nadine also stands out for being female in a major and a field that, though evolving, is still dominated by men. She's not deterred, however: she sees opportunity in being one of only a handful of women pursuing IS careers. "I feel like I have to work harder because I'm playing in a boys club, but I think being a minority is helpful in the job market. It's an advantage, it makes you unique," she said.</p>

<p>That uniqueness helped her score two prestigious summer internships, first with Exxon Mobil in Houston, and this past summer at KPMG's Phoenix office. Living in a different city for the first time was an exciting part of the Exxon Mobil internship, where Nadine worked running code for the Security division.</p>

<p>"It was great to be out on my own, and, as my first internship, it showed me more of the real world than I'd ever seen before," she said. But the personal interaction with clients she got to experience during the KPMG internship was more up her alley. As a KPMG intern, Nadine was located on-site at client's offices, where she worked as part of a team conducting security tests on the company's systems.</p>

<p>Having a position that was "people oriented while still keeping the technical aspect" appealed to her. The appeal, apparently, was mutual; Nadine recently accepted an offer from KPMG for a similar full-time position starting next year. With her immediate future on solid ground, Nadine is able to enjoy being selected as the department's Outstanding Graduating Senior. "It's an honor," she said.</p>

<p>"All of us in the department have worked really hard to get to where we are so it's great to be thought of as someone who stands out." Goul has no doubts that Nadine will continue to be recognized for her skill and diversity. "Nadine Yassine is prepared to be a global player in a world economy empowered by digital connectivity.</p>

<p>She has a unique and well-balanced world view, an insightful combination of coursework preparation, and she has already demonstrated a work ethic beyond her years," he wrote. Nadine, however, takes a simpler outlook: she looks forward to working in a field and a job she finds fulfilling. "Jobs are not about money or power for me, but about being comfortable and happy with what you do everyday," she said.</p>
